;1. Probability of Strategy Change = 0.1:
;- With a low probability of strategy change, the agents are less likely to switch their strategies.
;- The simulation may show relatively stable clusters of players with similar strategies.
;- Over time, you might observe some minimal changes in strategy as a result of the low probability.
;
;2. Probability of Strategy Change = 0.5:
;- A moderate probability of strategy change increases the likelihood of agents adopting more successful strategies from their neighbors.
;- You may observe more dynamic changes in the distribution of strategies over time.
;- Clusters of agents with the same strategy may break and merge as players adapt to more successful strategies.
;
;3. Probability of Strategy Change = 1:
;- With a high probability of strategy change, the agents are very likely to adopt the strategy of a more successful neighbor.
;- The simulation is expected to show frequent and rapid changes in strategy across the population.
;- There may be a tendency for a homogeneous strategy to dominate the entire population over time.
